# Python_Database_Profiling
A few programs to profile tables in a database. Most common value for an attribute, number of occurences etc

Converted from SAS code run in hadoop to Python querying a MySQL database (Hadoop version may follow at a later date)

THe programs are designed to give a quick overview of the data in a database. THe summary information includes things like the most common attribute for every field in a table and the number of occurences.
